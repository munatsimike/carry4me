# Carry4Me

Carry4Me is a peer-to-peer parcel delivery platform that connects senders with verified travelers to carry parcels safely and affordably across borders.

> Carry4Me is initially focused on helping diaspora communities send parcels back to their countries of origin by leveraging travelers already making the journey.

---

## 🚀 Vision

Sending parcels internationally is often expensive, slow, or inaccessible.
At the same time, many travelers have unused luggage space.

Carry4Me bridges this gap by matching senders with travelers, enabling faster,
more affordable, and community-driven parcel delivery while maintaining trust,
safety, and transparency for both sides.

## ✨ Core Features

### For Travelers

## 🔒 Trust & Safety

Trust and safety are core to the Carry4Me platform:

- **Inspection required**  
  Travelers only carry items they can inspect and approve.

- **No prohibited items**  
  Illegal drugs, weapons, cash, and hazardous goods are not allowed.

- **Choose your traveler**  
  Senders review traveler profiles and make informed decisions.

- **Clear responsibility**  
  Both sender and traveler confirm parcel handover and delivery.
